Of course this code is written in C++, which is my favorite programming language. I love programming in this language:))

But back to the main topic :smiley:


**What is Horner's diagram?**

Horner's scheme has two applications:

- we use it to divide polynomials by a polynomial, but only of the first degree.

- to calculate the value of polynomials for a given argument.


We will deal with the second case. We have the following polynomial:

$f(x) = ax^2 + bx + c$, which can also be written like this

$f(x) = x(ax + b) + c$
