Of course this code is written in C++, which is my favorite programming language. I love programming in this language:))

But back to the main topic :smiley:

Horner's scheme has two applications:

- we use it to divide polynomials by a polynomial, but only of the first degree.

- to calculate the value of polynomials for a given argument.
